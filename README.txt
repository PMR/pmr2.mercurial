Introduction
============

This package is the Mercurial wrappers for PMR2.


Notes
=====

This package will most likely be migrated to a new namespace under 
pmr2.backend.  This has the advantage of allowing multiple backends to
be supported by providing a common interface, which will be called
pmr2.backend.interface.
