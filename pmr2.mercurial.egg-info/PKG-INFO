Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package is the Mercurial wrappers for PMR2.
        
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        This package will most likely be migrated to a new namespace under
        pmr2.backend.  This has the advantage of allowing multiple backends to
        be supported by providing a common interface, which will be called
        pmr2.backend.interface.
        
        
        Correct implementation and usage of Zope, WSGI, Repoze
        ------------------------------------------------------
        
        While the original mercurial web implementation follows the wsgi
        standards, Zope/Plone didn't until I learned about repoze (refactored
        Zope server stack to follow wsgi).  This is why instead I extend hgweb
        to be part of the wsgi stack, I reuse/reimplemented a number of methods
        to be "compatible" with original zope.  However, now that I moved to
        using repoze some of these really should be rewritten to be compatible
        with that new stack.  Then again, this is working out well enough for
        now, so I am deferring the implementation of the "correct" approach
        until I have more time for it.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.7 - Released (2011-09-12)
        ---------------------------
        
        * Return location of subrepos for the pathinfo method, such that
        redirection can happen.
        
        0.6 - Released (2011-08-25)
        ---------------------------
        
        * No longer call pushbuffer as the output can be better controlled by
        assigning the output related variables.  This also prevent the output
        generated by unbundle (push requests) from being eaten alive before
        it can be sent back to the source.
        * Make the protocol request checker more lenient in what variables it
        will verify with.  Plone 4.1 instances can now push once more.
        
        0.5 - Released (2011-08-16)
        ---------------------------
        
        * Dependency updated to mercurial 1.9.1

        - This is now a full storage plugin for workspaces and no longer
        depended on by pmr2.app.
