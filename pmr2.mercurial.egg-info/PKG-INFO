Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package is the Mercurial wrappers for PMR2.
        
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        This package will most likely be migrated to a new namespace under
        pmr2.backend.  This has the advantage of allowing multiple backends to
        be supported by providing a common interface, which will be called
        pmr2.backend.interface.
        
        
        Correct implementation and usage of Zope, WSGI, Repoze
        ------------------------------------------------------
        
        While the original mercurial web implementation follows the wsgi
        standards, Zope/Plone didn't until I learned about repoze (refactored
        Zope server stack to follow wsgi).  This is why instead I extend hgweb
        to be part of the wsgi stack, I reuse/reimplemented a number of methods
        to be "compatible" with original zope.  However, now that I moved to
        using repoze some of these really should be rewritten to be compatible
        with that new stack.  Then again, this is working out well enough for
        now, so I am deferring the implementation of the "correct" approach
        until I have more time for it.
