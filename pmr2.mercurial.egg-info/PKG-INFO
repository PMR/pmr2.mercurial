Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package is the Mercurial wrappers for PMR2.
        
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        This package will most likely be migrated to a new namespace under
        pmr2.backend.  This has the advantage of allowing multiple backends to
        be supported by providing a common interface, which will be called
        pmr2.backend.interface.
